1. Please open any node AFTER reset STM32 board!!! 
	because I did not set up framehead or tail.
2. agribot_com.cpp is the main execution file. It's based on c++. You're fine to add any class functions.
3.agribot.launch is the launch file to execute agribot_com.cpp. There are parameters that you can alter before launching.
